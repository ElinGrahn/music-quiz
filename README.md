# Do you know modern music culture?

The purpose of this game is to test the players knowledge about moments and and songs in the modern music culture. With platforms like tiktok and instagram viral and well known moments are shared in a completely different way than it was before. You don't have to be a fan or even know an artist to keep up with everything that happens in the musical world, that information will be brought to you. Therfore it would be fun to test how aware people are.

## Typography and color scheeme

I wanted the game to have a youthful feel, since it is about the modern day music culture. The font family is Kalam from google fonts <!--link--> and the colors are in a soft neutral palette. I chose the colors from www.color-hex.com and htmlcolorcodes.com <!--Add links-->

### Code Validation

The code has been validated and found no errors by using these validators:

* W3C Markup Validator
  * Validation of the HTML
* Jigsaw (Validator)
  * Validation of the CSS
* JSHint
  * Validation of the JavaScript

### Test cases

### Fixed bugs

* Random Questions
  * I know I was supposed to use the math object but there seem to be many different ways to use it. In the end by following W3schools code I got there.
* Restarting the game
  * The game went back to the last question asked instead of really starting over, so I realised I had to set the number index to 0 again as well as the score.
* Getting the correct answer to show up. 
  * For some reason when the correct answer is clicked it does not turn green as I've written in the if statement. I'm thinking the computer can't read the boolean for some reason. Still have not solved this.
