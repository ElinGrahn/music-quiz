# Do you know modern music culture?

The purpose of this game is to test the players knowledge about moments and and songs in the modern music culture. With platforms like tiktok and instagram viral and well known moments are shared in a completely different way than it was before. You don't have to be a fan or even know an artist to keep up with everything that happens in the musical world, that information will be brought to you. Therfore it would be fun to test how aware people are.

## Typography and color scheeme

I wanted the game to have a youthful feel, since it is about the modern day music culture. The font family is Kalam from google fonts <!--link--> and the colors are in a soft neutral palette. I chose the colors from www.color-hex.com and htmlcolorcodes.com <!--Add links-->
